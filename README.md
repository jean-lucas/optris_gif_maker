## CSV to GIF

Convert CSV files generated by OPTRIS PIX tool to a GIF file.

### Pre-requisite

This assumes you have libirimager installed, if not, see:
http://documentation.evocortex.com/libirimager2/html/index.html


### Setup
	
- clone directory
- `cd <repo dir>`
- `mkdir build && cd build`
- `cmake .. && make`


Configure the following parameters in `gif_maker.sh`

- `exp_path` - where are the csv files located
- `frequency` - what was the time difference between each CSV snapshot


### Execute

- `chmod u+x gif_maker.sh`
- `./gif_maker.sh`

### Results

In the `exp_path` folder, three sub-folders will be generated
- `data` where all the csv files will be moved to
- `ppm` the generated ppm images from the `image_builder` executable
- `png` where the converted and fixed ppm files will be placed


The output GIF file can be found in `png/10/out.gif`
